I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Cockroach Labs this winter, working on [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) with the [KV](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/projects/57) team. Last fall I interned on the CockroachDB [SQL Experience](https://github.com/orgs/cockroachdb/projects/5) team!

Previously I also interned with GitHub Education on [GitHub Classroom](http://classroom.github.com/), and with Lyft working on [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) on the Data Infrastructure: Compute team.
