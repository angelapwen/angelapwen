I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Cockroach Labs this fall, working on [Cockroach DB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) with the [SQL Features](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/projects/46) team!

Previously I interned with GitHub Education on [GitHub Classroom](http://classroom.github.com/).
